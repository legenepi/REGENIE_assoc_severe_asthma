# Rationale
Sentinel selection, loci, and conditional analysis for the genome-wide significant regions discovered by the GWAS on severe asthma European ancestry participants in UK Biobank.

# Analysis
## Variant and loci selection
Code: src/broad_phenotype/postGWAS_analyses.sh
```{r, code = readLines('/home/n/nnp5/PhD/PhD_project/REGENIE_assoc/src/broad_phenotype/postGWAS_analyses.sh'), eval=FALSE}
```
Code: src/create_input_munge_summary_stats.R
```{r, code = readLines('/home/n/nnp5/PhD/PhD_project/REGENIE_assoc/src/create_input_munge_summary_stats.R'), eval=FALSE}
```
Code: src/sentinel_selection.R
```{r, code = readLines('/home/n/nnp5/PhD/PhD_project/REGENIE_assoc/src/sentinel_selection.R'), eval=FALSE}
```
Code: src/broad_phenotype/Create_oddsratio.R
```{r, code = readLines('/home/n/nnp5/PhD/PhD_project/REGENIE_assoc/src/broad_phenotype/Create_oddsratio.R'), eval=FALSE}
```
Code: src/merge_loci.R
```{r, code = readLines('/home/n/nnp5/PhD/PhD_project/Post_GWAS/src/merge_loci.R'), eval=FALSE}
```
Code: Fine_mapping_severe_asthma/src/Merge_sentinel_region.sh
```{r, code = readLines('/home/n/nnp5/PhD/PhD_project/Post_GWAS/src/Merge_sentinel_region.sh'), eval=FALSE}
```
Variants with a p-value equal to or below the genome-wide significant threshold of 5e-8 were extracted and the sentinel variant for each genomic loci was chosen as the one with the lowest p-value in its surrounding region of 1Mb (+/- 500Kb). If some loci were less than 500Kb apart, the loci were merged.

## Conditional analysis
Code: Post_GWAS/src/GCTA_cojocond.sh
```{r, code = readLines('/home/n/nnp5/PhD/PhD_project/REGENIE_assoc/src/broad_phenotype/Create_oddsratio.R'), eval=FALSE}
```
In order to investigate if there were other independently associated variants, I used the GCTA conditional analysis software with the --cojo-slct parameter which performs a stepwise model selection (v1.90.2beta) [1]. I analysed regions +/- 2Mb from the sentinel variants. The loci on chromosome 6 embrace the MHC region which has a complex LD structure; thus the conditional analysis is not used for this area.

Finally, Locus zoom plots were created using the free online tool LocusZoom v0.12 [2] to investigate the sentinel variants, their associated genomic loci, and surrounding genes (if any).

## Look-up of sentinel variants
Code: Post_GWAS/src/Lookup_in_modsev_imputed.R
```{r, code = readLines('/home/n/nnp5/PhD/PhD_project/Post_GWAS/src/Lookup_in_modsev_imputed.R'), eval=FALSE}
```
Code: Post_GWAS/src/Lookup_in_modsev_sequencing.R
```{r, code = readLines('/home/n/nnp5/PhD/PhD_project/Post_GWAS/src/Lookup_in_modsev_sequencing.R'), eval=FALSE}
```
Code: Post_GWAS/src/Lookup_snps_in_GBMI_asthma.sh
```{r, code = readLines('/home/n/nnp5/PhD/PhD_project/Post_GWAS/src/Lookup_snps_in_GBMI_asthma.sh'), eval=FALSE}
```
Code: Post_GWAS/src/Lookup_GBMI_sentinelvars.R
```{r, code = readLines('/home/n/nnp5/PhD/PhD_project/Post_GWAS/src/Lookup_GBMI_sentinelvars.R'), eval=FALSE}
```
I compared the results in literature from Shrine et al. [3], Global Biobank Meta-analysis Initiative (GBMI) [4], and Chang et al. [5].

# Results
Sentinel selections highlighted 17 loci which became 14 loci after merging nearby regions (Table 1).
<br>
The conditional analysis showed an additional independent variant on chromosome 10 (rs1444789) which is in linkage equilibrium with the sentinel rs201499805 (R2 0.06).
<br>
```{r, out.width='100%', out.height='200%', fig.align='center', fig.cap='Table 1.Sentinel variants summary statistics. Chr=Chromosome; GRCh37=Genome Reference Consortium Human Build 37; OR=Odds Ratio; 95CI=Confidence Interval.', echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics('/home/n/nnp5/PhD/PhD_project/REGENIE_assoc/src/report/Sentinel_table.png')
```
<br>
The three studies used for the look-up analyses revealed that 12 out of 14 loci has been already found associated with asthma or moderate-to-severe asthma (Table 2).
```{r, out.width='100%', out.height='200%', fig.align='center', fig.cap='Table 2.Look-up sentinel variants. CHR=Chromosome; BP=Base position; B37=Build 37; B38=Build 38; OR=Odds Ratio; CI=95% Confidence Interval; UKB=UK Biobank.', echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics('/home/n/nnp5/PhD/PhD_project/REGENIE_assoc/src/report/Lookup_Sentinel_vars.PNG')
```

# Conclusion
The GWAS revealed 7,198 genome-wide significant variants (p-value < 5 x 10-8), which represented 14 independent loci. Twelve of these loci had been previously reported in other studies, except those tagged
by rs778801698 and rs2523572 on chromosome 3 and 6 respectively.
