# Rationale
Run recessive and dominant genetic test models for GWAS of severe asthma individuals and compare the result with the additive model.
<br>
Historically, additive model is the most used for GWAS due to its value to pick more variants with small effects. However, in the last years, researchers have 
started to use the other genetic tests and to compare the results. 
<br>
We decide to do the same with our 46,086 individuals of European ancestry with severe asthma in UK Biobank

# Analysis
Run REGENIE association analysis with the three different model: same parameters, except for '--test', which was changed everytime according to the test type.
Additive is the default, 'recessive' and 'dominant' are the other two options.
<br>
All the three analyses started from 46,086 total individuals: 7,681 cases and 38,405 controls.
<br>
Number of analysed variants changed for the different tests:

 - additive: 34,396,871
 - recessive: 14,334,721
 - dominant: 34,297,344
 
I then retained results for variants with minor allele frequency (MAF) equal or greater than 0.01. These variants were used to calculate linkage 
disequilibrium score regression (LDSC) intercept, as measure of genomic inflation; obtain Q-Q plot and Manhattan plot; find sentinel variants and calculate odds ratio. 
<br>

# Results
The number of analysed variants with MAF > 0.01 is:

 - additive:  9,804,778
 - recessive: 9,804,101
 - dominant: 9,804,755

## Recessive
I obtained an ldsc intercept of 1.01 and Q-Q plot is shown below (Fig. 1):
```{r, out.width='50%', fig.align='center', fig.cap='Fig1. Q-Q plot recessive genetic test', echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics('/home/n/nnp5/PhD/PhD_project/REGENIE_assoc/output/Q-Q_plot_GWAS_maf001_broad_pheno_1_5_ratio_recessive.png')
```

Sentinel selection found 12 sentinel variants and loci (Table 1), visible in the Manhattan plot (Fig. 2):
```{r, echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
library(readxl)
recessive_sentinel <- as.data.frame(read_excel("/home/n/nnp5/PhD/PhD_project/REGENIE_assoc/src/report/Sentinel_variants_different_pheno.xlsx", sheet = "Broad_pheno_recessive"))
#remove row with NAs and row with case/controls numbers
recessive_sentinel <- recessive_sentinel[1:12,]
knitr::kable(recessive_sentinel,caption = "Table 1. Sentinel variants recessive test")
```

```{r, out.width='100%', out.height='200%', fig.align='center', fig.cap='Fig2. Manhattan plot recessive genetic test', echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics('/home/n/nnp5/PhD/PhD_project/REGENIE_assoc/output/Manhattan_plot_GWAS_maf001_broad_pheno_1_5_ratio_recessive.png')
```

```


## Dominant
I obtained an ldsc intercept of 1.01 and Q-Q plot is shown below (Fig. 4):
```{r, out.width='50%', fig.align='center', fig.cap='Fig4. Q-Q plot dominant genetic test', echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics('/home/n/nnp5/PhD/PhD_project/REGENIE_assoc/output/Q-Q_plot_GWAS_maf001_broad_pheno_1_5_ratio_dominant.png')
```

Sentinel selection found 15 sentinel variants and loci (Table 2), visible in the Manhattan plot (Fig. 5):
```{r, echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
library(readxl)
dominant_sentinel <- as.data.frame(read_excel("/home/n/nnp5/PhD/PhD_project/REGENIE_assoc/src/report/Sentinel_variants_different_pheno.xlsx", sheet = "Broad_pheno_dominant"))
#remove row with NAs and row with case/controls numbers
dominant_sentinel <- dominant_sentinel[1:15,]
knitr::kable(dominant_sentinel,caption = "Table 2. Sentinel variants dominant test")
```

```{r, out.width='100%', out.height='200%', fig.align='center', fig.cap='Fig5. Manhattan plot dominant genetic test', echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics('/home/n/nnp5/PhD/PhD_project/REGENIE_assoc/output/Manhattan_plot_GWAS_maf001_broad_pheno_1_5_ratio_dominant.png')
```

Miami plot between additive and dominant genetic test (Fig. 6):
```{r, out.width='50%', fig.align='center', fig.cap='Fig6. Manhattan plot dominant genetic test', echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics('/home/n/nnp5/PhD/PhD_project/REGENIE_assoc/output/Miami_plot_Eur_UKBB_broad_pheno_VS_broad_pheno_dominant.png')
```

# Conclusion
The number of variants analysed by REGENIE changed according to the type of genetic test: the recessive model is the one with the lowest number of variants, while the additive and the dominant are pretty comparable. However, the number of variants after MAF filtering is pretty much the same; this step in independent by the software and it happened after the REGENIE analysis.
<br>
All the three tests shared the majority of significant loci, in some cases with the same sentinel variants, in others with a different one. The dominant model revealed a genome-wide significant locus on chromosome 4, which is just below the genome-wide significant in the additive one (Fig. 6).
<br>
Neither the recessive nor the dominant showed evidence of genome-wide significance for the locus on chromosome 3 (rs778801698: dominant p-value 1.20 x 10-6, 
recessive p-value 6.69 x 10-6).
